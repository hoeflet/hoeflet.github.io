We study evolutionary and molecular genetics of viral infections. Using experimental evolution, we focus on important phenotypes such as antiviral resistance, immune evasion, virulence as well as genetic conflict and cooperation within viral populations.

Herpesviruses are among the most prevalent and diverse animal viruses known to mankind. Virtually every animal species harbors one or more different species of herpesvirus, regardless whether mammal, fish, amphibian, mollusk, bird or reptile. Given this immense variation, herpesviruses are the ideal order to study host-pathogen adaptation.

During replication of their genome, herpesviruses introduce a moderate amount of mutations. We utilized DNA-polymerase mutants to increase mutation rates and therefore accelerate evolution. We can do this thanks to the two separate enzymatic functions of B-family DNA-polymerases: 5'-3'-polymerase and 3'-5'-exonuclease function.
